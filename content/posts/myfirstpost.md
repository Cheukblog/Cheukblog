Testing! This blog was created by following this great tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LIFvgrRxdt4. It was insightful to see how github submodules can be used to seamlessly host sites off github pages, and how easy it is to create nice looking blogs with Hugo. I created an organisation called Cheukblog so that I can have the URL of the blog: "cheukblog.github.io". All this was done in around 30 minutes, great for a simplistic blog. I am considering to switch to next.js in the near future rather than Hugo due to the better features and documentation, however I found Hugo super straightforward to setup and saved me a lot of time.

Note that I will date posts before this to match when I worked on the relevant projects, but they will have actually been written after this date.

Thanks for reading, and I hope everyone will enjoy Cheukblog.

```python
print("Hello World!")
